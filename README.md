<h1>The Icecream Parlour</h1>

<p>This site is my first assignment built in COMP2084 Server Side Scripting. 
It uses MVC 5, SQL Server, Entity Framework and Twitter Bootstrap.</p>
<p>I got the idea to develop this site as I work at Baskin Robbins - a famous icecream restaurant!</p>
<p>Bootstrap Slate theme from: <a href = "https://bootswatch.com/3/slate/">https://bootswatch.com/3/slate/ </a></p>
